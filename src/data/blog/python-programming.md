# Bonsai Care Guide for European Climates

Maintaining tropical bonsai species in continental European climates presents unique challenges. This comprehensive guide covers seasonal adjustments, indoor housing solutions for winter months, and species-specific tips.

## Winter Protection Strategies

During winter months, tropical bonsai species need special protection:

1. **Temperature Control** - Maintain minimum temperature of 10-15째C (50-59째F)
2. **Humidity Management** - Use humidity trays or small humidifiers
3. **Light Requirements** - Supplement with grow lights during short winter days

## Spring Transition Period

As temperatures begin to rise in spring:

1. Gradually acclimatize your bonsai to outdoor conditions
2. Start with a few hours of filtered sunlight daily
3. Increase exposure time over a 2-week period

## Species-Specific Recommendations

### Ficus Varieties
Ficus bonsai are among the most adaptable tropical species for European environments. They can tolerate brief periods at temperatures as low as 5째C, though not optimal.

### Tropical Juniper
Unlike their hardy cousins, tropical junipers require consistent temperatures above 7째C to thrive.

## Seasonal Maintenance Calendar

| Season | Focus Area | Key Actions |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Winter | Protection | Indoor placement, reduced watering |
| Spring | Growth | Repotting, fertilization begins |
| Summer | Development | Regular pruning, abundant sunlight |
| Autumn | Preparation | Reduce fertilizer, prepare for winter |

With proper care adjustments, tropical bonsai can not only survive but thrive in European conditions.
