# 5 Global Bonsai Trends in 2025

The art of bonsai continues to evolve as it spreads globally. Here are the five most significant trends we're observing in the international bonsai community this year.

## 1. Forest-Style Arrangements (Yose-ue)

Forest-style or group plantings are experiencing a significant revival, particularly in European markets. These arrangements feature multiple trees of the same species planted together to create a miniature forest landscape.

Key characteristics driving this trend:
- Creates more dramatic visual impact in modern home interiors
- Allows for expression of natural forest dynamics
- Offers greater design flexibility for collectors

## 2. Incorporation of Native European Species

European enthusiasts are increasingly applying traditional bonsai techniques to local species:

- European Olive (Olea europaea)
- Cork Oak (Quercus suber)
- European Beech (Fagus sylvatica)

This trend represents the beautiful evolution of bonsai beyond its Asian origins while respecting traditional techniques.

## 3. Smart Bonsai Care Systems

Technology is transforming bonsai maintenance with:

- IoT soil moisture monitors
- Automated watering systems with phone notifications
- Light measurement tools for optimal placement
- Climate control mini-greenhouses

These innovations are making it easier for novices to succeed with their first bonsai.

## 4. Deadwood Emphasis Styling (Jin and Shari)

Styles emphasizing deadwood elements (Jin and Shari techniques) are seeing increased popularity, particularly for:

- Junipers
- Pines
- Old-growth tropical species

This aesthetic celebrates the resilience and age of trees through deliberately styled deadwood features.

## 5. Kusamono Companion Plantings

The traditional art of kusamono (decorative accent plants displayed alongside bonsai) is experiencing a renaissance with:

- Native wildflower arrangements
- Seasonal accent plants
- Miniature landscapes (saikei)

As bonsai collections mature, enthusiasts seek these complementary elements to complete their display presentations.

These trends reflect the continuing evolution of an ancient art form as it adapts to contemporary aesthetics and global environments.
